# My ZSH Setup with Powerlevel10k (Set default to Powerlevel9k)
To run this script to copy the config make sure you have zsh installed!

Run the script: `./installreqs.sh`

#### If you have ZSH already installed please backup your .zshrc before you run the script

Set ZSH as your default shell:

`chsh -s $(which zsh)`

# Standard theme
To render the theme correctly set a Powerline patched font as your terminals font or as your IDE font. Enjoy!
